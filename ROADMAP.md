# reversing-mcp roadmap

Tracking note for follow-up bridge improvements, cross-cutting features,
and integrations identified during real-world RE sessions. Each item is a
self-contained chunk of work — pick whatever's highest leverage.

Effort estimates assume working in-tree with the existing patterns:
**S** = under 100 LOC, ~1 hour · **M** = 100–500 LOC, ~half a day · **L** = full feature, ~1+ days.

## ★ Next-up top priority: Interactive markdown notebook (in-IDA GUI)

A dockable IDA Pro view that renders the per-IDB scratch notebook as live
markdown with bidirectional links to the IDB. Auto-updates as you make
discoveries; embedded code blocks pick up renames automatically.

### Streaming-style rendering (UX requirement, NOT decoration)

The viewer must render new content **as it arrives**, not all-at-once. The
"bam, here's 3000 chars of markdown, now scroll for days" experience is
exactly what we're avoiding. Agents should be able to stream their thinking
into the notebook the same way Claude's own output streams — section header,
then a sentence, then another sentence, then a code block, scrolling along
with the new content as it lands.

Implementation: this isn't a server-side push; it's just **bridge polling +
agent chunking**.

- Bridge side: scratch_append (already shipped) lets the agent send arbitrary
  small chunks. No new endpoint needed for the MVP — but a thin convenience
  wrapper `scratch_stream(category, [chunk1, chunk2, ...])` that fires the
  chunks with brief delays makes the agent's intent explicit and the UX
  smoother.
- Viewer side: poll the scratch netnode every ~100 ms; if `size` increased,
  re-render the tail and auto-scroll to the new bottom. (Re-render the
  *whole* notebook is fine too — typical notebook ~10 KB, rendering is
  cheap.) Skip auto-scroll if the user has manually scrolled away from
  the bottom — standard chat-UI pattern.

### What makes it more than a viewer

- **Live inline code** — markdown source like `{{decompile:0x1814C4AA0}}`
  expands to the *current* Hex-Rays output at render time. Rename a local
  variable in IDA → the embedded code block in the notebook re-renders to
  show the new name. No copy/paste, no staleness.
- **Clickable anchors** — auto-link `sub_XXXXXX` and `0x...` to `ida://...`
  URLs; click dispatches to `ida_kernwin.jumpto(addr)`.
- **Auto-refresh on IDB changes** — subscribed to `IDB_Hooks` (rename,
  cmt_changed, func_added, func_deleted). Anything you do in the IDA UI
  is reflected in the notebook within a render tick.
- **Streaming append** — when MCP `scratch_log` writes a new section, the
  view scrolls to it.

### Layers

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| GUI form | `ida_kernwin.PluginForm` subclass + Qt `QTextBrowser` (HTML render, anchor clicks). Hotkey `Ctrl+Shift+N` to open. |
| Markdown render | Python `markdown` + custom extensions for `{{decompile:...}}`, `{{disasm:...,n}}`, `{{xrefs:...}}`. Auto-link addresses + sub_XXXXXX. |
| Click dispatch | `QTextBrowser.anchorClicked` → parse `ida://...` → `jumpto(ea)` / open Hex-Rays / trigger named action. |
| Auto-refresh | `ida_idp.IDB_Hooks` subclass + `execute_sync` re-render scheduler. Also wired into `scratch_replace`. |

### Endpoints to add

- `scratch_show()` — open the viewer.
- `scratch_refresh()` — force re-render.
- `scratch_stream(category, chunks: list[str])` — convenience wrapper for
  streamed sections; fires `scratch_section_start` + N `scratch_append`
  with small delays so the viewer renders it incrementally rather than
  all-at-once. Optional — `scratch_append` chained from the agent works
  equally well; this is just ergonomic sugar.

### What to steal

- IDA SDK `ex_pluginform.py` for form scaffolding.
- `lighthouse` (the IDA coverage plugin, MIT-licensed) for the
  `PluginForm + Qt widget + IDB_Hooks` pattern — the cleanest open-source
  example.
- Python `markdown` + `mdx_gfm` extension for tables/strikethrough.

### Effort

**L** (~500–800 LOC over two focused sessions). Worth doing right rather
than rushing.

## ✅ Shipped this session: IDA debugger integration

22 new endpoints (`dbg_state`, `dbg_attach`/`launch`/`detach`/`terminate`,
`dbg_continue`/`pause`/`run`, `dbg_step_into`/`over`/`out`,
`dbg_run_until_ret`, `dbg_run_to`, `dbg_set/del/list_breakpoint(s)`,
`dbg_read/write_memory`, `dbg_get/set_reg`/`get_regs`, `dbg_wait_event`,
`dbg_callstack`/`threads`/`modules`) plus Hex-Rays local-var endpoints
(`rename_local_var`, `set_local_var_type`). Verification target — the
Saleae buffer-capture flow described below — is the next session's first
task. Original design notes preserved below for context.

## ★ Original proposal: IDA debugger integration

IDA has a full built-in debugger (Windows/Linux/macOS, local + remote, every
arch IDA supports). Wiring it into the bridge unlocks **dynamic analysis** —
the missing capability that the iLok wall on Saleae's `graph_server_shared.dll`
defeated us with statically. The wire-format serializer is virtualized, but
the *output* of the serializer (the bytes about to be written to USB) is
plaintext in a buffer we can read by breaking on `WinUsb_WritePipe` and
inspecting the args. We dont have to crack iLok — we just have to see what
it produced.

Same workflow generalizes:
- Step into a function and watch state evolve to validate the structs we
  defined (the field offsets are right? wrong?).
- Set a write-watch on a memory address to find every code path that
  modifies a struct field.
- Run-to-address to skip past the iLok decoder loop and resume at a
  predictable post-decode state.

### Endpoint surface (~16 endpoints)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dbg_attach(pid)` / `dbg_launch(path, args)` / `dbg_detach()` | Process attach + lifecycle |
| `dbg_run()` / `dbg_pause()` / `dbg_continue()` | Run-state control |
| `dbg_step_into()` / `dbg_step_over()` / `dbg_step_out()` | Single-step |
| `dbg_run_to(addr)` | Temp BP + continue (common idiom) |
| `dbg_set_breakpoint(addr, type)` / `dbg_del_breakpoint` / `dbg_list_breakpoints` | BP management. `type ∈ {sw, hw_exec, hw_read, hw_write, hw_rw}` |
| `dbg_read_memory(addr, size)` / `dbg_write_memory(addr, hex)` | Live memory R/W (auto-pauses if running) |
| `dbg_get_reg(name)` / `dbg_set_reg(name, value)` / `dbg_get_regs()` | Register R/W |
| `dbg_callstack()` / `dbg_threads()` / `dbg_modules()` | Process introspection |
| `dbg_wait_event(timeout_ms)` | Blocking poll: returns `{event: "bp"\|"exception"\|"exit"\|"timeout", details}` |

### Implementation notes

- Python API: `idc.start_process`, `idc.attach_process`, `idc.suspend_process`,
  `idc.resume_process`, `idc.run_to`, `idc.step_into`, `idc.step_over`,
  `idc.set_bpt`, `idc.del_bpt`, `idc.get_reg_value`, `idc.set_reg_value`,
  `idc.read_dbg_memory`, `idc.write_dbg_memory`, `idc.get_thread_qty`,
  `idc.get_callstack`. Mature, well-documented, all callable from the
  main-thread queue we already use.

- **State machine is the hard part**: the debuggee runs asynchronously.
  The bridge must track `{detached, attached_paused, attached_running, exited}`
  and gate operations accordingly (e.g. `dbg_read_memory` while running
  should either auto-pause or return a clear error). Add a small
  `dbg_state()` endpoint.

- **Event pump**: `dbg_wait_event(timeout_ms)` is the natural primitive.
  Internally it uses `ida_dbg.wait_for_next_event(WFNE_SUSP, timeout)` or
  the equivalent. Polls naturally fit the MCP request/response model.

- **Anti-debug**: Saleae's binary may have iLok-installed anti-debug checks.
  If so, `dbg_attach` will be detected. Workarounds (ScyllaHide, stealth
  plugins) are out of scope for the bridge — we just need to attach
  successfully or fail cleanly with a useful error.

### Effort

**M+ to L**. ~200–300 LOC on `ida/plugin.py`, plus matching MCP wrappers.
Mostly mechanical once the state machine is right.

### Verification target

The dogfood test is the Saleae buffer-capture flow: launch Logic 2, attach,
BP at `WinUsb_WritePipe` call inside `WindowsUsbDevice__Write`, trigger a
Logic 2 capture, dump `(rdx, rcx)` on each hit, collect a corpus of real
FX3 commands. Cross-reference against the `*_CommandHandler` string names
already in `saleae_native/notes/dll_protocol_strings.md` to map opcode
bytes → command names.

## IDA bridge (`ida/plugin.py` + `ida/mcp_server.py`)

The most-developed bridge. Surface is solid for static work, gaps are around iteration ergonomics.

| # | Endpoint | Why | Sketch | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `list_types`, `get_type` | Read back defined types so we can iterate on a struct without losing the previous definition or grepping the IDB. Right now `define_type` is one-shot and opaque. | `idc.get_type(name)` for the C-decl string; iterate `ida_typeinf.get_ordinal_qty()` and `ida_typeinf.get_numbered_type()` for listing. | S | Proposed |
| 2 | `rename_local_var`, `set_local_var_type` | The 80% readability win still missing from decompiles. Locals like `v10, v40, Buffer` are real state we should be able to name + type. This compounds across re-decompiles. | `ida_hexrays.rename_lvar(func_ea, old, new)` and `ida_hexrays.set_lvar_type(func_ea, name, tinfo)`. Need a fresh `cfunc_t` per call. | M | Proposed |
| 3 | `set_struct_member_comment` | Annotate individual struct fields (e.g. "this is std::optional has-value flag") without redefining the whole struct. Keeps annotation stable across edits. | `ida_struct.set_member_cmt(member_t, cmt, repeatable)` — or the new typeinf equivalent. | S | Proposed |
| 4 | `/auto_status` | Lets agents tell "no xrefs because indexing isn't done" from "no xrefs, period". We guessed for hours during the Saleae pass. | `ida_auto.auto_is_ok()` + `ida_auto.get_auto_state()` returning `{idle, pass_name}`. | S | Proposed |
| 5 | `/log_tail?lines=N` | Surfaces what's in IDA's Output window. We need this to see why Hex-Rays popped a modal (the actual error text), and to confirm rename/comment side-effects. | `ida_kernwin.msg_get_lines(N)`. | S | Proposed |
| 6 | `parse_decl` (dry-run for `define_type`) | When the agent is unsure if a C decl is well-formed, validate without committing. Saves "did that actually parse?" round-trips. | `idc.parse_decl(decl, flags)` returns `None` on error. | S | Proposed |
| 7 | `bulk_rename(names: list[(addr,name)])` | We already fan out N parallel rename calls today, but a single batched endpoint would amortize the IDA-main-thread tick cost. | One handler that iterates inside `_run_on_main_thread` so the timer drains in one tick. | S | Nice-to-have |

## Ghidra bridge (`ghidra/`)

Has the original IDA surface but **not the new endpoints we added in this branch** (`define_type`, `apply_type`, `set_function_prototype`, `add_segment`, `set_segment_attrs`). The MCP wrappers are 1:1 mirrors — the gap is on the Java/Ghidra side.

| # | Endpoint | Why | Sketch | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | `define_type` (Ghidra side) | Parity with IDA. Ghidra's `DataTypeManager` + `DataTypeParser` does this; can take a single C declaration string. | `DataTypeParser.parse(decl)` → add to `program.getDataTypeManager()`. | M |
| 9 | `apply_type` | Apply a `DataType` at an address via `program.getListing().createData(addr, dt)`. | M |
| 10 | `set_function_prototype` | `Function.setSignature(FunctionSignature)` after parsing the C decl. | M |
| 11 | `add_segment` / `set_segment_attrs` | `program.getMemory().createInitializedBlock(...)` / `MemoryBlock.set*(...)`. Useful for marking MMIO regions in firmware. | M |
| 12 | `rename_local_var` / `set_local_var_type` | Equivalent of IDA item #2 on Ghidra's decompiler — `HighFunctionDBUtil.updateDBVariable(...)`. | M |

## jadx bridge (`jadx/`)

Mostly stable for read-only queries. Mutation isn't really applicable (jadx is a decompiler, not an IDE — it doesn't have a persistent "user-edited DB" the way IDA/Ghidra do).

| # | Endpoint | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | `search_methods` | Substring search across method names globally (currently you have to list-classes then filter). Useful for "find all `verify*` methods". | S |
| 14 | `get_method_xrefs_from` | Outgoing calls from a method — what does it invoke? Complements existing `xrefs_to`. | S |

## ILSpy bridge (`ilspy/`)

Same — read-only by nature. Add the missing read endpoints to match jadx surface.

| # | Endpoint | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | `get_class_metadata` / equivalent | Mirror jadx's `get_class` — return type info + method list without source. | S |
| 16 | `xrefs_to` (call sites) | The C# decompiler library exposes a usage analyzer (`UsageAnalysis`). Wire it up. | M |

## Unicorn bridge (`unicorn` branch)

The branch is functional. Future work is mostly use-case driven:

| # | Endpoint | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 17 | `/load_elf` / `/load_pe` | Auto-map sections from a binary file (today the agent does `map_region` + `load_file` by hand). Lower priority — the manual composition is *the* test of generic primitives. | M |
| 18 | `/fuzz_until_crash` | Run a function with mutated input (AFL-unicorn-style) until a `UcError` fires; return the failing input + register state. | L |
| 19 | `/coverage` / `/trace_basic_blocks` | Always-on block trace exposed as a queryable list — for measuring how much of a function we explored. | M |

## saleae_native (`saleae` branch)

The IDA RE found that the wire-format serializer is iLok-virtualized — static reverse won't work past that. The realistic finish-line is sigrok-cli shim, not pushing through. See `saleae_native/notes/session_2026-05-15_ida_pass.md` for the carry-forward.

| # | Item | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| 20 | Refactor `driver.py` as a `sigrok-cli` subprocess wrapper. Endpoints become flag mappings on top of `sigrok-cli --driver saleae-logic-pro`. | M |
| 21 | USBPcap a live Logic 2 capture, recover the 500 MS/s mode bytes sigrok hasn't reversed, contribute upstream. | L |
| 22 | Debug-port-finder mode (passive JTAG/SWD/UART classifier on the captured samples). | M |

## Hybrid static + dynamic (cross-bridge composition)

The bridges already compose loosely — an agent (Claude) can pull bytes
from one bridge and feed them to another. Several patterns are worth
codifying as cookbook recipes or meta-tools:

### IDA static → Unicorn emulation (no new bridge code required)

Pull a function's bytes via `ida.get_bytes`, map + load into Unicorn,
write registers, run, observe. ~8 MCP calls today; works on the existing
servers. Killer apps:

- Validate struct-field hypotheses without re-decompiling.
- Crypto/hash function discovery: emulate with known inputs, check
  outputs against an oracle.
- Branch exploration to map reachable code paths.

Worth writing as `cookbooks/ida-to-unicorn-emulation.md`.

### IDA debugger → Unicorn (iLok bypass via runtime dump)

The big one for the Saleae case. iLok JIT-allocates its VM bytecode at
runtime addresses outside the static PE (`0x1C99508A7`-ish), which means
pure-static Unicorn can't follow. **Combination**: use IDA's debugger
(top-priority item above) to attach to a live Logic 2, wait for iLok to
materialise the VM region, `dbg_read_memory` to dump it, then feed the
dump into Unicorn. Now we can emulate the post-iLok serializer offline
with mutated inputs, indefinitely, no live process required.

Three legs of the stool: **static IDA + IDA debugger + Unicorn**.

### Meta-tool: `emulate_function(idb, address, arch_instance, inputs)`

Once the unified `reversing_mcp.py` lands (cross-cutting item #23), it
can expose meta-tools that bridge across servers in one call:

```python
emulate_function(
    idb="graph_server_shared",
    address="0x1807EB510",
    arch_instance="x86_64",
    inputs={"rcx": 0x1234, "rdx": 0x40000000},
    timeout_ms=5000,
) -> {final_pc, regs, exit_reason}
```

Internally: 8-call dump+map+load+run sequence. Externally: one tool call.
Effort: **S** once the unified server is in place.

## Cross-cutting

| # | Item | Why | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 23 | **Unified `reversing_mcp.py`** | One stdio MCP server replacing the per-tool ones. User installs one entry in Claude Code instead of five; cross-tool meta-tools (`compare_ida_vs_ghidra_decompile(addr)`) become possible. Bridges-in-tools layer is unchanged. | M |
| 24 | **`version_info` MCP tool + 24h GitHub Releases cache** | The MCP can tell the user "an update is available" opportunistically. ~50 LOC in `common.py` + one tool wrapper. | S |
| 25 | **`install.py --update`** | `git pull` + re-run build/deploy for already-installed tools. Idempotent. | S |
| 26 | **GitHub Actions release pipeline** | Tag push (`v*`) → CI builds jadx fat JAR + ILSpy bin + Ghidra ZIP (if a Ghidra dir is provided as a workflow input) → attaches to release. Lets `install.py --update` pull binaries instead of building locally. | M |
| 27 | **x64dbg integration** | New `x64dbg/` bridge using `~/Desktop/x64debug/pluginsdk/`. Surface: `attach/detach/run/step_*/breakpoints/regs/memory/callstack/run_command`. Dynamic debug complements static IDA/Ghidra perfectly. | L |
| 28 | **Bridge testing under load** | The Saleae session found two distinct failure modes — modal-dialog wedge (fixed via `idc.batch`) and PID-kill via `os.kill(pid, 0)` on Windows (fixed via `OpenProcess`). Suite of fault-injection tests would catch the next class of these. | M |

## Recently shipped (just so future-you knows what's done)

- `define_type`, `apply_type`, `set_function_prototype`, `add_segment`, `set_segment_attrs` on the IDA bridge. (`cb84048` ish)
- Modal-dialog watchdog + `idc.batch(1)` per-handler wrapping in `_MainThreadTimer._tick`.
- Windows-safe PID liveness check in `common.py` (do not regress this — it killed a live IDA during dev).
- `install.py` interactive installer with build+deploy+register actions for all five tools.
- `unicorn` and `saleae` branches pushed, not merged.
